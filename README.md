# Doggy Terminal
Doggy Terminal is an open-source project I'm working on.
This is a command-line tool that I designed primarily for Windows because I see that most terminals and development tools are made for Linux systems, and with this terminal I want to make the work of Windows developers easier.
The terminal is currently under development and dont have any official release, but I will update the Github respository with each update of code, and if you want to use it before the first release, you can download the code and use it, if you have any ideas, you can write to the following email address:
